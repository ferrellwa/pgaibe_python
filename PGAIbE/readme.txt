"Programming Game AI by Example" by Mat Buckland, reimagined in Python

	I've started this project to begin my path to Pythonic mastery as needed for my new job.
Although my work-use of Python will be for SysAdmin scripting, I wanted to tackle a more
interesting project to learn the interworkings of Python without any hand holding.
	Game artificial intelligence was the original reason I ever wanted to program. I vividly
remember playing The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask on N64 back in the day and thought to
myself "wow! The game characters are living inside of this game!" Of course, I later found out
that what enamored me as a child was actually a simplistic timing system, but I still feel
those emotions when playing through a game with "smart" NPCs. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion
really blew my mind with their NPC scheduling (Radiant AI), and piqued my interest in studying
Computer Science at West Virginia University. The rest is/will be history.
	"Programming Game AI by Example" by Mat Buckland is one of the defining texts on practical
video game artificial intelligence. The acclaimed book is written very well, gives industry
standard answers to a variety of game AI related obstacles, and is a must-have for anyone even
curious about the subject. All of the examples in the book are written in C++, so my goal is to
transcribe each mini-project into Python to hone my skills while learning/coding something I
genuinely enjoy.
